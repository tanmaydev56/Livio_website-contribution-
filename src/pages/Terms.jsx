                  including standard shipping, expedited shipping, and possibly
                  same-day delivery, depending on the location and availability.
                  Each option will have different costs and delivery times,
                  which will be clearly stated at the checkout.

                  <strong>Delivery Times:</strong> Estimated delivery times are
                  provided at the time of purchase. These estimates are based on
                  several factors, including the selected shipping method,
                  destination address, and the availability of the items
                  ordered. While LIVIO strives to meet these estimated delivery
                  dates, several factors can affect actual delivery times:
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul className="products-sublist">
                <li>
                  <strong>Weather Conditions:</strong> Adverse weather
                  conditions can delay shipping and delivery.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Carrier Delays:</strong> Delays caused by shipping
                  carriers, such as postal services or courier companies, are
                  beyond our control.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>High Demand Periods:</strong> During peak seasons,
                  such as holidays, there may be additional delays due to high
                  order volumes.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul></ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Tracking Orders:</strong> Once your order is shipped,
                you will receive a shipping confirmation email that includes
                tracking information. This allows you to monitor the progress of
                your shipment in real-time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shipping Costs:</strong> Shipping costs are calculated
                based on the shipping method selected, the destination of the
                shipment, and the weight and dimensions of the package. Shipping
                charges will be clearly displayed at the checkout before you
                complete your purchase.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>International Shipping:</strong> For customers outside
                the country where LIVIO is based, international shipping options
                may be available. Additional customs fees, duties, and taxes may
                apply and are the responsibility of the customer. Delivery times
                for international orders may vary significantly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shipping Issues:</strong> If you encounter any issues
                with your shipment, such as lost or damaged items, please
                contact our customer service team. We will work with you and the
                carrier to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

                  accessible on our website. Generally, the following conditions

                  <strong>Return Eligibility:</strong> To be eligible for a
                  return, items must be in their original condition, unused, and
                  with all original packaging and tags attached. Some items,
                  such as clearance or custom-made products, may not be eligible
                  for return. Specific eligibility criteria will be outlined in

                  return process within a specified period from the date of
                  delivery, typically 30 days. This timeframe allows sufficient
                  time for customers to inspect their purchases and decide if
                  they are satisfied.

              <ul className="products-sublist">

                  with the product.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Shipping the Return:</strong> Use the provided return
                  shipping label (if applicable) or arrange for return shipping
                  at your expense. We recommend using a trackable shipping
                  method to ensure the item is returned safely.
                </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Refunds:</strong> Once the returned item is received and
                inspected, LIVIO will process the refund based on the original
                method of payment. The following details apply:
              </li>
              <ul className="products-sublist">
                <li>
                  <strong>Refund Amount:</strong> The refund amount will
                  typically include the original purchase price of the item,
                  excluding any shipping charges. In some cases, restocking fees
                  may apply, as outlined in the Return Policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Processing Time:</strong> Refunds are usually
                  processed within a few business days after we receive and
                  inspect the returned item. The time it takes for the refund to
                  appear in your account may vary depending on your payment
                  provider.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Refund Notification:</strong> You will receive an
                  email notification confirming that the refund has been
                  processed. If there are any issues with the return or refund,
                  our customer service team will contact you for further
                  information.

              <li>
                <strong>Exchanges:</strong> If you prefer to exchange an item
                rather than receive a refund, please contact our customer
                service team. We will assist you in selecting a replacement item
